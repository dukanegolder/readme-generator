## Installation

In order to install inquirer, please use "npm i inquirer@8.2.4"

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

"node index.js"

## Usage

In order to use this project, the user will need to copy and paste all the code into vscode. Once this is done, the user will right click on the file "index.js" and click "use intergrated terminal". Next, in teh actual terminal, the user will start the prompts by typing in "node index.js". After this is complete, the prompts will appear and the user can follow the instructions in all of the prompts guiding them on what to type. When all of the prompts are complete, there will be an alert that will say "Successfully created new README!" at the bottom of the terminal. The user will then notice in the "new-readme" folder, the new read me file will be created with the answers that were used from the prompts where the user can edit the file how they please. Here is the example video below.
